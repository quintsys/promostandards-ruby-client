    # ProductPricingAndConfiguration provides methods to interact with the
    # PromoStandards Product Pricing and Configuration service. This service
    # allows users to retrieve pricing and configuration details for specified
    # products, supporting various localization and customization options.
    #
    # The module includes methods for constructing and sending SOAP requests,
    # validating required configurations, and parsing responses.
    #
    # == Usage
    #
    #   # Example call to get product configuration and pricing
    #   client = PromostandardsRubyClient::Client.new
    #   response = client.get_configuration_and_pricing("G500")
    #
    # == Methods
    #
    # * +get_configuration_and_pricing+ - Retrieves pricing and configuration
    #   details for a specified product.
